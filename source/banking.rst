Banking Policies
================

**We firmly believe that financial institutions should 
not discriminate against anyone, regardless of the circumstances.
We believe that financial institutions should not marginalize market 
actors on the basis of their political orientation, sexual orientation, 
race, age, ethnicity, religion, national origin, or political speech.**

The recent actions of large financial institutions have forced us to make
this policy.



PayPal
------

PayPal is a multinational financial technology company that operates an 
online payment system that supports online money transfers.  PayPal provides 
an electronic alternative to traditional paper checks, money orders or 
wire transfers. 

Some of our customers and vendors have expressed that they wished to be 
paid through the PayPal network.  In the past, we have done so, especially 
for international vendors.  

However, after serious thought we have decided to no longer do business 
with PayPal given the current environment for the following reasons:

* Most recently, PayPal issued then retracted a policy to fine users $2,500 
  for “misinformation."   The policy was originally set to go into effect 
  on November 3, 2022.  The policy has been interpreted to mean that PayPal 
  could take $2,500 from a linked bank account, effectively embezzling 
  money through the application of punitive “fines.” 

* Recently, PayPal has started to shutdown personal and business accounts, 
  allegedly targeting “conservative” media organizations and/or individuals, 
  based on their protected political speech.

* Historically, PayPal has been known to shutdown accounts, without warning, 
  for legitimate businesses.  Reportedly, the money is seized and held for 
  months or years.  During shutdowns and siezures, the targeted business/individual 
  is usually left without little recorse except expensive litigation.

Therefore, we have made the difficult decision that we will not do business 
with PayPal or PayPal's subsidiaries.
